  # Some SDKs support pluggable KV stores, the properties under "credentialStore"

    # here for properties like url, db name, etc.
    path: "/tmp/hfc-kvs"

    # [Optional]. Specific to the CryptoSuite implementation. Software-based implementations like
    # CryptoSuite_ECDSA_AES.js in node SDK requires a key store. PKCS#11 based implementations does
    # not.
    cryptoStore:
      # Specific to the underlying KeyValueStore that backs the crypto key store.

channels:

    # channel. This list can be a result of access control ("org1" can only access "ordererA"), or
